# Frozen-set
-> Frozen-set is predefined class, it is a set datatype.
-> It's functionality is similar to set.
-> set is both mutable and immutable but frozen-set is immutable.
-> Frozen-set doesn't have any notations.
-> But we can write as a = frozenset(list,tuple,set,dict,etc)
->we can create two types of frozenset objects. They are
			a) Empty frozenset
   syntax: a = frozenset()
			b) Non-Empty  frozenset
-> frozenset does'nt follow insertion order. So we can't do indexing and slicing.

**Predefined funtions**

->frozenset  contains the following Functions
			a) copy()  only deep copy
			b) isdisjoint()
			c) issuperset()
			d) issubset()
			e) union()
			f) intersection()
			g) difference()
			h) symmertic_difference()
-> We can't use any updating or changing operators to frozenset.
